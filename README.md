## Hi there 👋

I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Manchester's Department of Mathematics. I am researching modelling the biomechanical networks of the lung.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...  
- Simulating the behaviour of a 2D tessellation of alveoli under a ventilation-vertex model  
- Working out scaling this model to 3D alveoli
